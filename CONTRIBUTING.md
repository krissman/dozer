## Working on the code
We recommend to work on the code from [github](https://github.com/DozerMapper/dozer/).

    git clone https://github.com/DozerMapper/dozer.git
    cd dozer

Build the project:

    mvn clean install

If you intend to work on the code and provide patches and other work you want to submit, then you can fork the project on github and work on your own fork.
The custom work you do should be done on branches you create, which can then be committed and pushed upstream, and then submitted as PRs (pull requests).
You can find many resources online how to work on github projects and how to submit work to these projects.
