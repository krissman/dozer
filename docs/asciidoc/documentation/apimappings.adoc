== API Mappings
=== XML Mapping Flaws
XML-based approach is stable and is used in many production projects.
However, it imposes several limitations.

* First, and most important, is that it can not be dynamically
generated. All XML mappings should be present on Dozer start-up and can
not be modified afterwards. There are tricky ways, when you can generate
and put mappings to the file system by your own templating engine, but
this approach is not supported by Dozer itself. By generating custom
mappings you are able to automate repetitive chunks of low-level Dozer
language.
* Second problem is that you are forced to duplicate all of your Bean
class names in Xml mappings. This leads to lots of typing and copy-paste
programming. This can be partly compensated by use of Expression
Language inside Xml, but it is not solving all of the problems.
* Refactoring support is limited as IDE should keep track of class names
in Xml files and change them when you rename or move the referenced
class. Auto-completion support is also not available in all IDEs.

=== API Mappings
API mappings are intended to solve all of the mentioned problems. To
preserve backwards compatibility API mappings can be combined with
existing Xml mappings. In fact some parts of the configuration (e.g.
global configuration block) are only possible to express in Xml format.

To get a feeling of what are these mappings take a look at the following
code example.

                )
                    .exclude("excluded")
                    .fields("src", "dest",
                            copyByReference(),
                            collectionStrategy(true, RelationshipType.NON_CUMULATIVE),
                            hintA(String.class),
                            hintB(Integer.class),

                            customConverterId("id")
                    )
                    .fields("src", "dest",
                            customConverter("com.github.dozermapper.core.CustomConverter")
                    );
            }
        };
    }
}

Constructed builder object should be then passed to `DozerBeanMapperBuilder`.
It is possible to add multiple Builder classes.

Mapper mapper = DozerBeanMapperBuilder.create()
        .withMappingBuilder(builder)
        .build();
